## **Day 1**: `0x434C49434B`

**Hint** : You should have seen the chaos when the Elves overflowed their 32-bit password method counter.

**Explain** Ascii code for 'CLICK'
  
  
## Day 2: `surprisingly extensive` 

**Hint** : They even sell lunch boxes and blue tents!

**Explain** : This is a reference to the [Gift Shop](https://blueprince.wiki.gg/wiki/Gift_Shop) in [Blue Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Prince), which sells various ingame items including a lunch box and blue tents.

## Day 3: `offline`

**Hint** : Escalator temporarily stairs. Sorry for the convenience. 

**Explain** : This is a reference to a quote from the stand-up comedian Mitch Hedburg: "I like an escalator, because an escalator can never break. It can only become stairs. You'll never see an 'Escalator Out of Order' sign, only 'Escalator Temporarily Stairs. Sorry for the convenience.'"

## Day 4: `big`

**Hint** : This joke is stupid and I love it.

**Explain** : The joke is a pun based on the double meaning of “print job.”

- Literal meaning:

    A massive printer in the corner sounds like an office printer meant for very large documents.

- Implied meaning (the joke):

    “Really big print jobs” is slang for taking a huge poop. So the “massive printer” in the corner is actually a toilet.

## Day 5: `spoiled`

**Hint** : No, this puzzle does not take place on Gleba. Why do you ask?

**Explain** : This is a reference to [Gleba](https://wiki.factorio.com/Gleba) from [Factorio: Space Age](https://www.factorio.com/), a planet where you have to build a factory around items that spoil. It's pretty obnoxious to filter out what stuff is fresh compared to what is almost about to spoil, so having a problem about doing that is on brand for the planet.

## Day 6: `garbage smasher` 

**Hint** : To your surprise, the smell isn't that bad.

**Explain** : It refers to Star Wars: A New Hope, specifically the scene where Luke, Han, Leia, and Chewbacca are trapped in the garbage compactor on the Death Star.

>- Will you forget it? I already tried it! It's magnetically sealed.

## Day 7: `quantum`

**Hint** : Please disregard the wave interference patterns that would arise from the wave-particle duality of individual tachyon particles while repairing the manifold.

**Explain** : In quantum mechanics, a [wave interference pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference) is a sign that particles actually act like waves even when they would be expected to behave as particles instead. This is not needed for (and breaks the explanation of) this problem, hence the request to ignore it.

## Day 8: `all in the same circuit`

**Hint** : I strongly recommend making an interactive visualizer for this one; it reminds me a lot of maps from futuristic space games.

**Explain** : Probably it needs to create a 3d visualizer of the connection and see the result.
